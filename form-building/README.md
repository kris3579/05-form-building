## Overview
Create a form for user's to input their own blog post for our page, and have a preview template of their blog appear as they fill in the form, otherwise known as "live-update".

## Getting Started
1. Create a form for the page.
2. Add a event handler to the form in order to "live-update" a preview of the user's blog by listening for changes to the form.
3. Have the event handler "live-update" a JSON snippet below the preview. 
4. Have the event create a new article by using toHTML(), then add it to the articles.

## Architecture

## Change Log
